Offer shipping methods to customers based on quantities, classes, or categories!

== Description ==

Are you a business owner who likes to offer your customers the best? Do you also like to be able to pack up early on a Friday?
Now you can be both! Offer your customers the BEST shipping deals that are going to get out TODAY! Charge an extra fee (or don't), but cut the deal off at 3pm on Friday (or any other day!)

Promote shipping deals on special orders that let YOU guide your customers into making decisions that benefit your bottom line.

**Example:**
Average order is 1 t-shirt for $20. It costs you $6 to ship anywhere with your rate. If a customer orders up to 3 t-shirts, it still only costs you $6 to ship.
Using this plugin, you can make a ruleset either via product categories or shipping classes to offer a new shipping rate if a customer orders 2 or 3 t-shirts rather than 1 or 4+

**Example 2:**
You have a scheduled pickup with your shipping service of choice TheRiteShipping Co. at 3:30pm every day. On your website you have "2 day delivery" as an option, but it really counts as 3+ days if they order at 3:45pm.
Using this plugin, you can disable the "2 day shipping" option at 3:30pm every day until midnight or even over a weekend (or time span) to reduce friction and confusion among your customers.

See screenshots for examples of making an "advanced flat rate" method.
